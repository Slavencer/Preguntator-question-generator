# Preguntator-question-generator
This is a simple script to help you convert a pdf to the txt format that preguntator expects.

It only removes part of the work, but for now you still have to:
- if an option is several lines, it will need to be put into one.
- set the correct option, as different pdfs will set the correct option differently

# Disclaimer
This script serves as a starting point to avoid copy pasting the whole pdf into a txt file. If the script fails to do so, feel free to tailor it for your specific case!
